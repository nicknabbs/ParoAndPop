                        <p>Yes! All our ear wires are made from hypoallergenic materials including gold-plated, stainless steel, or sterling silver options. They're safe for sensitive ears.</p>

                        <h3>What materials do you use?</h3>
                        <p>We use sustainably sourced wood (primarily birch and walnut), eco-friendly acrylic paints, protective sealants, and hypoallergenic metal hardware.</p>

                        <h3>How big are the earrings?</h3>
                        <p>Sizes vary by design, but most of our earrings range from 0.5" to 2" in length. Specific dimensions are listed in each product description.</p>

                        <h3>Are the earrings heavy?</h3>
                        <p>No! Wood is naturally lightweight, so even our larger designs are comfortable for all-day wear. Most pairs weigh less than 0.3 oz.</p>

                        <h3>How should I clean my earrings?</h3>
                        <p>Gently wipe with a soft, dry cloth after wearing. For deeper cleaning, use a slightly damp cloth and dry immediately. Avoid harsh chemicals or soaking in water.</p>

                        <p>Our earrings are sealed with a protective coating to prevent fading. With proper care, colors should remain vibrant for years.</p>
