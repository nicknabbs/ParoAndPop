                <p class="page-subtitle">From a small garage workshop to thousands of happy customers worldwide - discover the passion behind every pair of earrings we create.</p>
            </div>
            
            <section class="our-story">
                <h2>How It All Started</h2>
                <p>Back in 2018, what began as a creative outlet during long winter evenings has blossomed into a thriving family business. Sarah, our founder, started crafting earrings in her garage workshop after watching "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" for the hundredth time and being inspired to create something that would bring joy and spark conversations.</p>
                
                <p>The first pair? You guessed it - those now-famous Christmas Vacation cat earrings that have become our #1 bestseller! What started as a fun experiment for friends and family quickly grew when people started asking, "Where did you get those earrings?"</p>
                
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>We believe jewelry should tell a story, spark conversations, and bring joy to everyday moments. Every pair of earrings we create is designed to be more than just an accessory - it's a way to express your personality, share your passions, and connect with others who appreciate unique, handmade artistry.</p>
                
                <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Handcrafted Quality:</strong> Every pair is individually made with attention to detail</li>
                    <li><strong>Unique Designs:</strong> From movie-inspired to racing themes, you won't find these anywhere else</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainable Materials:</strong> We use responsibly sourced wood and eco-friendly finishes</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Touch:</strong> Each order is hand-packed with care</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer First:</strong> Your satisfaction is our top priority</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Meet the Team</h3>
                <p>Our small but mighty team includes Sarah (founder and lead designer), Mike (production and laser cutting), and Jessica (customer service and shipping). We're based in a small town in the USA, and we love what we do!</p>
